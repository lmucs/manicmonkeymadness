It's really cool,but the fort builder was a little confusing because I didn't know how to rotate the bars.I liked the other monkeys though.

The monkeys were really cute,and Iiked how some of them were eating watermelons.I didn't get a good aim,so can you provide a crosshair ?I think it would really help the players.(It was how much power each cannon gave that cut me off.)
