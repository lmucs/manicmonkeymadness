#summary Manic Monkey Madness from 30,000 feet
----

Here is a quick overview of the project architecture, from both physical and logical perspectives;

= Physical Architecture =

The game is physically packaged as a project with the following directory structure:
{{{
.
├── src
│   ├── META-INF
│   └── manicmonkeymadness
└── war
    ├── WEB-INF
    │   ├── appengine-generated
    │   ├── classes
    │   │   ├── META-INF
    │   │   └── manicmonkeymadness
    │   └── lib
    ├── audio
    │   ├── effects
    │   └── music
    ├── images
    │   ├── backgrounds
    │   ├── icons
    │   └── sprites
    ├── scripts
    │   ├── box2d-2.1
    │   ├── modules
    │   │   └── ui
    │   ├── states
    │   └── types
    ├── styles
    └── test
        └── js
}}}

The game is deployed as a single war file on the Google App Engine.  Front end tests are deployed so that the test suite can be invoked from the game itself.
