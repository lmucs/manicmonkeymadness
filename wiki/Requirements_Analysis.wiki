#summary Don't most software engineering projects have a requirements workflow?
----

During the first week of class, we picked a project and sketched out rough requirements.  As development unfolded, and feedback came in, we filled in our detailed requirements.

= Rough Requirements =

  # M3 shall run as an application on a web page, inside a {{{<canvas>}}} element.
  # The game shall run on Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari.  It need not run on IE or mobile browsers.
  # The top level subsystems, or modules, shall include:
    * Domain objects: player, fortress, monkey, projectile, launcher, etc.
    * Physics: collision detection, trajectory computation
    * Graphics: sprites, background, animation engine
    * Sound: native HTML5 {{{<audio>}}} element
    * Game logic: turn taking, scoring
    * Persistence: database to track high scores
    * Service layer: to interact with the database

= Detailed Requirements =

== General ==

  # The game shall be deployed to Google App Engine at {{{manicmonkeymadness.appspot.com}}}
  # The game shall consist of a single page containing
    * A canvas which scrolls horizontally
    * A link to the main project page
    * A link to view the current high scores
    * A link to show help as an overlay div
  # Communication with the server shall use the Ajax methodology
  # The game shall begin with configuration options
    * Fort Selection: choose from some premade forts or create a custom fort with the level editor.
    * Game Mode: players can choose from two game modes:
      * Last Monkey Standing: The person to elimate all their opponents monkeys wins.
      * Demolition Derby: Each player gets the same determined amount of shots and the highest score wins.
  # The game shall be turn-based
  # During each turn:
    * The current player may select a weapon
    * The current player configures the launcher and fires a projectile
    * The projectile shall be animated and the canvas shall scroll to keep the projectile visible
    * Projectiles flying in the world above the viewport shall be tracked with some indicator that makes sense to a reasonable human player
    * Collisions, if any, shall be tracked and animated, with the corresponding updates applied to the object world.
    * The current player's score (and the corresponding display) is updated as the physics computations are running
    * The turn shall be deemed to have ended according to the following:
      * If in Last Monkey Standing Mode, all of the opposing monkeys have been destroyed
      * In Demolotion Derby Mode, the full number of turns have been taken by each player
  # At the end of each turn, the game shall determine if the current player has won
    # If so, the game will indicate the winning player
    # If not, the other player will become the current player
  # At the end of the game, the winner's score is checked against the persistent high scores list.
    * If the new score would be one of the top ten high scores for the given game type, the player is offered a change to submit his or her name (and score) to the server to be recorded. 

== Display ==

  * The canvas shall be horizontally scrollable
  * The background scroll shall use parallax or similar effect
  * The number of turns taken by each player shall be visible
  * If in Demolition Derby Mode, the number of total turns shall be visible 
  * The number of remaining monkeys per player may be tracked
  * Icons for toggling sound, toggling music, and accessing help shall be prominent

== Sound ==

  * Sound effects shall use HTML5 audio, no Flash
  * Music shall be of original composition only

== Fort Editor ==

  * TODO

= Non-Functional Requirements =

  # People with a little bit of experience with games shall be able to just start playing
  # The help text shall be written in decent English, without too many spelling and grammar mistakes
  # The game shall not crash the hosting browser
  # The game shall make people laugh when they see that monkeys can be shot out of cannons
