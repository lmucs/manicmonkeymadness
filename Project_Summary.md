Manic Monkey Madness, or M3, is a two-player, physics-based game in which monkeys go head to head in order to destroy each other's fortress and claim treasure. Players take turns strategically aiming their shots to cause the most destruction to the opposing fortress. The characteristics of the projectiles, as well as their launch angle and velocity, determine how large or small of an impact a hit will make on the opposing fortress. A single well-placed shot could be as devastating as multiple poor or average shots. The monkeys will sling anything and everything that they can get their hands on, so it is up to the players to decide which weapon will cause the most chaos for the opposition.

Manic Monkey Madness was developed as a course project at Loyola Marymount University from September through December, 2010 C.E.   The students chose to implement a game entirely with HTML 5 (no Flash!) with original graphics and original music, and a modest server deployed on Google App Engine.
