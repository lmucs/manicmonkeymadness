# Introduction #

The music included in m3 consists of two original songs, named (rather creatively) "Monkeys" and "Metal Monkeys."  Both were created using a combination of [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/), the free drum machine for Linux, and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), the sound recording software; and pure, unadulterated awesomeness.

Originally we wanted to use Metallica's "Ride the Lightning," be we didn't want to get sued by [Lars Ulrich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Ulrich).

# Hydrogen #

[Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org) is an open source program made specifically for GNU/Linux.  All of the drum tracks from both songs were created using it (unfortunately, none of us play the drums) and exported as WAV files, which we imported into Audacity.

Looks intense, right?

# Audacity #

To add the guitar, we set up a microphone to take input from our amps, and used [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to record.  We played it over the drum track, which, as I said, we imported into Audacity in WAV form.  We then used Audacity to repeat parts that needed to do so, and exported them as MP3 and OGG files.  We then included them in the game using html5 audio.

# Future #

We plan to add bass tracks to each song eventually, and also include a bridge and a [sweet guitar solo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEBSxP725w) in "Metal Monkeys."
