Angry Birds, as of late 2010, appears to have only a slingshot for launching (although we counted at least 7 birds).  Perhaps having a variety of launchers would be a nice differentiator for M3.

In no particular order, here are some things that monkeys may use in battle.  We started this list in a single brainstorming session, and it has grown over time. Please feel free to update this list whenever you get a great idea.

### Launchers ###

  * Cannon
  * Slingshot
  * Teeter totter
  * Vine (for swinging monkeys)
  * Tree branches (used as a baseball bat)
  * Catapult (like from castles)
  * Board stuck to ground

### Projectiles ###

  * DK barrel with Diddy kong inside :)
  * Birds with powers :)
  * Rock
  * Banana -- super bouncy
  * Banana -- ripe
  * Banana -- exploding
  * Banana bunch (3 bananas)
  * Watermelon
  * Watermelon -- exploding
  * Monkeys (shot from cannons or swinging on vines)
  * Guano
  * Skulls
  * Monkeys riding missiles (a la Dr. Strangelove)
  * Slime bomb (makes everything on enemies' side sticky)
  * Grenade
  * Knives

### Projectile-like Weapons ###

  * BB Gun :)
  * Charging elephants or rhinos
  * Bazooka (able to use every 5 turns) :)
  * Something like Angry Birds' Mighty Eagle -- perhaps an Azhdarchid?
  * A bulldozer -- would be funny with monkeys at the wheel
  * Wrecking ball
